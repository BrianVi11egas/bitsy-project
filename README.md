# bitsy-project

## Star Wars!!! Hell yeah!!!

The scene I have chosen for this project is the final scene of *Star Wars: A New Hope (Episode 4)*, I feel like it is a scene that can be well represented inside of Bitsy.
Also interesting for it to be seen in 8-bit for as I am limited to what I can put into my version 

**Scene 1**:

**Scene 2**:

My idea for this project was to line a few people up on two sides, just like the first scene, in a way you can even talk with them. There being different kinds of people. However, with the limited capability of bitsy, most of them will have the same dialouge, the second scene is what I will incorporate in the second room. Where you talk to Leia and collect a medal that will be next to her, of course you would talk to her before collecting the medal. Upon collecting it is when it will end.
